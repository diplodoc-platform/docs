# Notice about collecting statistics

You can notify your app users that statistics will be collected, and initialize the SDK with disabled statistics sending before getting consent. This section describes the steps to disable and enable statistics collection:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Android

   To initialize a library with statistics sending option disabled, pass the value `false` into the `withStatisticsSending(boolean value)` method when creating an extended library configuration.

   ```java translate=no
   // Creating an extended library configuration.
   AppMetricaConfig config = AppMetricaConfig.newConfigBuilder(API_key)
           // Disabling sending statistics.
           .withStatisticsSending(false)
           .build();
   // Initializing the AppMetrica SDK.
   AppMetrica.activate(getApplicationContext(), config);
   ```

   After the user has confirmed to send statistics (for example, in the application settings or in the agreement on the first start of the app), you should call the `AppMetrica.setStatisticsSending(Context context, boolean enabled` method to enable it:

   ```java translate=no
   // Checking the status of the boolean variable. It shows the user confirmation.
   if (flag) {
       // Enabling sending statistics.
       AppMetrica.setStatisticsSending(getApplicationContext(), true);
   }
   ```

- iOS (Objective-C)

   To initialize a library with statistics sending option disabled, set the value `NO` for the `statisticsSending` property of the `YMMYandexMetricaConfiguration` configuration.

   ```objectivec translate=no
   // Creating an extended library configuration.
   YMMYandexMetricaConfiguration *configuration = [[YMMYandexMetricaConfiguration alloc] initWithApiKey:@"API_key"];
   // Disabling sending statistics.
   configuration.statisticsSending = NO;
   // Initializing the AppMetrica SDK.
   [YMMYandexMetrica activateWithConfiguration:configuration];
   ```

   After the user has confirmed to send statistics (for example, in the application settings or in the agreement on the first start of the app), you should call the `+setStatisticsSending:` method of the `YMMYandexMetrica` class to enable it.

   ```objectivec translate=no
   // Checking the status of the boolean variable. It shows the user confirmation.
   if (flag) {
       // Enabling sending statistics.
       [YMMYandexMetrica setStatisticsSending:YES];
   }
   ```

- iOS (Swift)

   To initialize a library with statistics sending option disabled, set the value `NO` for the `statisticsSending` property of the `YMMYandexMetricaConfiguration` configuration.

   ```swift translate=no
   // Creating an extended library configuration.
   let configuration = YMMYandexMetricaConfiguration.init(apiKey: "API key")
   // Disabling sending statistics.
   configuration?.statisticsSending = false
   // Initializing the AppMetrica SDK.
   YMMYandexMetrica.activate(with: configuration!)
   ```

   After the user has confirmed to send statistics (for example, in the application settings or in the agreement on the first start of the app), you should call the `setStatisticsSending(_:)` method of the `YMMYandexMetrica` class to enable it.

   ```swift translate=no
   // Checking the status of the boolean variable. It shows the user confirmation.
   if flag {
       // Enabling sending statistics.
       YMMYandexMetrica.setStatisticsSending(true);
   }
   ```

{% endlist %}
