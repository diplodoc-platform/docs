# Deleting data

You can delete all the data collected through AppMetrica that belongs to your username.

Data is divided into several categories:

- App records. In this case, any data collected by Yandex about these apps will be deleted.
- Folders.
- Partners.

You can delete data all together or separately for each category.

To delete data:

1. Open the [Your data on Yandex](https://passport.yandex.ru/profile/data) page and log in with the Yandex ID that you use to work with AppMetrica. To log in, enter the code from an SMS sent to the phone number linked to this Yandex ID.
2. Under **Delete data**, select AppMetrica.
3. In the window that opens, click **Delete** next to the selected data category. If you decide not to delete the data, click **Cancel**.

Once deleted, no one can access your data and Yandex stops using it.

You can restore the data collected through AppMetrica within 14 days after deletion. To do this, contact support. After 14 days, the data cannot be restored.
