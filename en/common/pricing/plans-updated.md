# AppMetrica Updates Pricing Plans: Set Limits the Way That Suits You

We are updating our pricing plans and making them more flexible, so you can choose the one that fits your needs. You will be able to select the required amount of events, easily manage your expenses, and use more resources when necessary. These changes relate to the Custom and Pro plans and take effect on **April 25th**.

## New Flexible Pricing Plans {#new}

Now, you can control the volume of custom events: choose the required limit or exceed it, if needed.

### What will change {#changes}

- The **Unlimited Custom Events** option has been removed from the Custom and Pro plans.
- The Custom plan will allow you to choose limits: 300 million, 900 million, 2 billion, 5 billion, 10 billion, or 15 billion custom events.
- The Pro plan will include 20 billion events by default, and if exceeded, you can enable the **Allow Overlimit Payment** option or contact us.

## What is Overlimit Payment and How Does It Work? {#upon-limit}

Overlimit payment is the option to pay only for the custom events that were actually used. You can forecast custom events without delays in data retrieval. Previously, events that exceeded the limit were placed in a buffer and then became unavailable after 14 days, with no possibility of recovery. Now, for Custom and Pro plans, each extra million of events can be paid for at a fixed price of $0.80. 

### How to Enable Overlimit Payment {#payment}

A new option, **Allow Overlimit Payment**, will appear in the interface. By enabling it, you can use additional events without restrictions. Also we will add a widget to monitor limits and track expenses. 

This option will be available only on the paid plans and when you reach the limit - it will not be active in the free version of AppMetrica. For example, if you are at the Custom plan with a 300 million events limit, but you’ve reached 305 million events in a given month, enabling **Allow Overlimit Payment** will allow you to pay for the additional custom events without switching to a higher plan.

If you don’t enable the option, the system will continue to work as before: when the limit is reached, events will stop loading.

Thus, you can choose your strategy: stay within the plan’s limits or pay for overages at a fixed rate.

## Advantages of New Plans {#advantages}

- **Flexibility**: Choose the plan with the required volume of events and avoid overpaying for excess limits.
- **Savings**: If you slightly exceed the limit, you can simply pay for the difference instead of upgrading to a more expensive plan.
- **Control**: Enabling overlimit payment is done manually, at your discretion.

These changes relate to the Custom and Pro plans and take effect on **April 25th**, and the transition to the new plan will happen automatically. You can always change the plan in the AppMetrica’s interface — just select the one that suits you in the settings.
