# Troubleshooting

{% note alert %}

Customer service specialists can only advise you on the app statistics for the login you use to contact them. You can see your login in the top-right corner of the screen.

If you have a general question, the login doesn't matter.

{% endnote %}

If you have an Android app, make sure that it complies with the updated Google Play geodata use and transfer policies. For more information, see the [documentation](../data-security/requirements-google-play.md).

If you didn't find the answer you were looking for, you can use the feedback form to submit your question. Please describe the problem in as much detail as possible. Attach a screenshot if possible.
