# Compare segments and time periods right in the AppMetrica interface

In AppMetrica, you can now compare data for various user segments and time periods directly in the reporting interface — without switching between tabs or other additional actions.

This new feature is available in all reports in the new interface except User Acquisition, User Acquisition SKAdNetwork, and Remarketing. The feature will be added to these reports later.

## Why compare segments and time periods?

Comparing user segments and time periods helps you:

- Test hypotheses and identify behavioral patterns.

- Measure the impact of campaigns, releases, and product changes.

- Compare expectations against actual results and make data-driven decisions.

## What can you compare?

You can analyze:

- **Different time periods**. For example, May vs. June or one quarter compared to another.

- **Different user segments**: by gender, age, platform, traffic source, and other parameters. For example, men aged 25–34 vs. women within the same age group.

- **Different segments across different time periods**. For example, compare the behavior of users coming from social media in May with the behavior of users from organic traffic in June.

Test your hypotheses, identify patterns, and compare campaigns and time periods — directly in AppMetrica reports.
