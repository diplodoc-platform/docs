# Segmentation

{% note alert %}

You can configure Yandex.Direct ad campaign targeting by AppMetrica segments. To do this, save a segment in AppMetrica and add it to [YandexÂ Audience](https://yandex.ru/support2/audience/en/segments/app-metrica). For more information, see [How to set up retargeting](https://yandex.ru/adv/news/kak-nastroit-retargeting-dlya-reklamy-mobilnykh-prilozheniy).

{% endnote %}

AppMetrica collects and processes a large volume of information about apps and their users. To pull the desired data from the full set of statistics, you can create a [segment](*segment). For example, you can use segments to get statistics for tablet users who installed the app in Russia, but now they are in the US.

A segment is created by using criteria to filter data. A filter can consist of one or more criteria. When selecting multiple criteria, you can use the "AND" and  "OR" operators. If you select criteria in the same filter, the  "OR" operator is applied. If you select criteria in different filters, the  "AND" operator is applied.

You can save the resulting segments and use them when [creating push campaigns](../push/marketing.md).

{% note info %}

Saving segments option is only available to users with [editing rights](../common/access.md).

{% endnote %}

Segmentation is available in all AppMetrica reports, but the number of available filters depends on the selected report. When you switch between reports, AppMetrica applies the selected filters to the data in the new report. If any of the filter criteria can't be applied, AppMetrica displays them in the **Incompatible filters** section.

AppMetrica has two levels of segmentation filters:

- [User level](#users-segment)
- [Report level](#specific-segments)
