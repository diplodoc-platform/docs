# Remarketing

The Remarketing report contains information about [remarketing campaigns](*remarketing campaigns) that are launched to return an audience to your app. There is a special tracker type for remarketing campaigns. For more information, see [Creating a remarketing tracker](../mobile-tracking/add-remarketing-tracker.md).

The report displays data about the users that returned to the app ([re-engagement](*re-engagement)), as well as target events they have completed. AppMetrica counts re-engagements when a user runs the application after clicking on the tracking URL or re-engagement deeplink.

The report allows you to pull out certain users by defining [data segments](segmentation.md). You can apply only [user level](segmentation.md#users-segment) segmentation filters for the report.

{% endcut %}

## Report period {#period}

The report is formed for a specific time period. The default period is one week.

{% include [period](_includes/period.md) %}

## Data for deeplinks {#deeplinks}

You can choose to display in the report the data for all [deeplinks](*deeplink) or for [re-engagement](*re-engagement) deeplinks only.

A regular deeplink captures metrics only at the time of the first opening. The re-engagement deeplink tracks user actions in multiple sessions until another campaign changes its status.

The choice affects the calculation of metrics from the [Main metrics](#main-metrics) block. All other metrics are calculated only for re-engagement deeplinks.
