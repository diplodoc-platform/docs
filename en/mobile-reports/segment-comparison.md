# Comparing segments and time periods

In the reports, you can compare data by selected segments or time periods.

## Time period comparison {#compare-time-periods}

To compare the selected period with the previous period of the same length, click **{{ comparison }}** → **{{ compare-to-period }}**. Charts for the first time period are displayed with solid lines, and for the second — with dashed lines.
