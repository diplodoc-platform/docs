The report contains metrics grouped into dimensions.

To set up dimensions and metrics:

1. Click the buttons **Dimensions**, **Metrics**, and **Data** one by one. The **Data** button is only available for some reports.
2. In each window, add dimensions and metrics you want to use to build the report.
3. Configure the order of metrics and dimensions.

   The order of metrics determines the order of columns, the order of dimensions determines the nesting of rows in the table.
