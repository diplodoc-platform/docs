# Overview

**{{ overview }}** is the main AppMetrica [workspace](workspaces.md) with [widgets](widgets.md). On the **{{ overview }}** page, you can find summary statistics for your app. This information helps quickly track important metrics of your app, such as User Acquisition, Retention, and the share of Crash-free sessions. In the overview workspace, you can configure the display of widgets, reorder them, and change their settings.

By default, only some widgets are enabled in the overview workspace. You can add both [preset](widgets.md#preset) and [custom](widgets.md#custom) widgets. To do that, click **{{ button-add }}** in the upper-right corner.
