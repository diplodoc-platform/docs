# Analysis of app crashes

AppMetrica doesn't conflict with other libraries that collect and process app crashes. If you use such libraries, initialize AppMetrica after installing these libraries.

The library does not symbolicate or deobfuscate app crashes. These operations are performed on the server or on the client side. For more information, see [Uploading dSYM files on iOS](../../../data-collection/upload-dsym.md).
