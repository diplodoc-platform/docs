## The number of sessions does not increase {#session-count}

Check your session tracking settings. For more information, see [Tracking user activity](ios-listen.md).

## There are no events in the report {#no-events}

1. Perform a minimum of 10 app actions that trigger the event sending.
   It's necessary because AppMetrica accumulates events in the buffer and sends to the server in several parts.

2. Wait for 10 minutes and check the report. Reports don't display events immediately.

## Problems with Swift Package Manager {#swift-manager}

Read the articles ['Library Not Found' error when you launch the app on your device](../../../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#library-not-found) and [Error installing library on the device](../../../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#trouble-load).

## AppMetrica crashes with unrecognized selector {#unrecognized-selector}
