# About the libraries

The AppMetrica SDK is a set of libraries for collecting app usage statistics. You can see the data you've collected in the {% if locale == 'ru' %}[AppMetrica web interface](https://appmetrika.yandex.ru/){% endif %}{% if locale == 'en' %}[AppMetrica web interface](https://appmetrika.yandex.com/){% endif %}.

The SDK lets you track the following data:

- device information
- session information
- referral information (how the user got to the app download page)
   user actions inside the app
- user location
   errors that occurred during app usage
- custom events
- other data (such as the number of users who have installed the app)

The SDK includes libraries for the following platforms:

- Android (starting from version 5.0.0).
- iOS and iPadOS (starting from version 9).
- tvOS (starting from version 9).
