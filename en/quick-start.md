# Getting started

## Step 1. Log in

You need a Yandex account in order to use AppMetrica. If you don't have one, [register](https://passport.yandex.ru/passport?mode=register).

## Step 2. Add a company

Specify the company's details: name, website (if any), type, and size.

## Step 3. Fill out a profile

Choose your team and enter an email address for notifications and service updates.

{% note info %}

By creating a profile, you accept the terms of the [User Agreement](https://legal.yandex.ru/metrica_termsofuse/).

{% endnote %}

## Step 4. Add an app to AppMetrica

Specify the app parameters: link in the app store (if the app hasn't been published yet, leave the field empty), name, category, and time zone for generating reports.

To add another app, click [Add app](https://appmetrika.yandex.ru/application/new) in the drop-down list in the AppMetrica interface.

## Step 5. Integrate the AppMetrica SDK into the app

On the **Settings** page, note the API key. You'll need this key to add the AppMetrica SDK to your app. We recommend using the same API key for the same app on different platforms.

For more information, see the instructions for adding the SDK to your [Android](sdk/android/analytics/quick-start.md) and [iOS](sdk/ios/analytics/quick-start.md) apps.

If integration was performed correctly, the **Apps** section will show statistics after some time.
